  <em>TES (Task Execution Service) on kubernetes!!!</em>
</div>

A [TES] compliant task execution service built on kubernetes with `security`,
`scalability`, and `ease of use` in mind.

## Basic Usage

> **Note:** This is a high-level overview. For more details, please refer to the
> [Basic Usage Docs](https://poiesis.vercel.app/docs/usage/usage.html).

At its core, `Poiesis` lets you run a single task via a GA4GH TES-compliant API.
But since it runs natively on Kubernetes, it’s far more versatile:

- Use Poiesis as the execution backend for workflow engines
- Launch thousands of batch tasks efficiently on Kubernetes
- Train and track ML models using reproducible task definitions

Whether you're running a one-off container or building full workflows, Poiesis
abstracts away the complexity—so you can focus on what to run, not how to run
it.

## Installation

> **Note:** This is a high-level overview. For detailed instructions, please
> refer to the
> [Deployment Docs](https://poiesis.vercel.app/docs/deploy/deploying-poiesis.html).

To install Poiesis into your Kubernetes cluster using Helm:

1. Navigate to the Helm chart directory:

   ```bash
   cd deployment/helm
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
  helm dependency build
  ```

1. Run the following command to install Poiesis:

   ```bash
   helm install poiesis . -n poiesis --create-namespace
   ```

This will install Poiesis into a new namespace called `poiesis`.

## Development

To get started with development:

> **Note:** This is a high-level overview. For detailed instructions, please
> refer to the
> [Development Docs](https://poiesis.vercel.app/docs/dev/starting-locally).

1. **Create a virtual environment** using
   [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

   ```bash
   make v
   ```

   > Note: You’ll need to install `uv` first — see their docs for setup
   > instructions.

1. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   *(Optional: alias this command to something like `sv` for convenience.)*

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   make i
   ```

1. **Start all the services**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./deployment/dev.yaml
   ```

1. **Set environment variables**:

   - Copy the `.envrc.template` to `.envrc` and fill in the necessary values.
   - If you’re using [`direnv`](#setting-environment-variables-direnv), it will
     automatically load `.envrc`.
   - Alternatively, you can load the file manually:

   ```bash
   source .envrc
   ```

1. **Run the server**:

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

### Makefile

For ease of use, certain scripts have been abbreviated in `Makefile`, make sure
that you have installed the dependencies before running the commands.

> **Note**: `make` commands are only available for Unix-based systems.

To view the commands available, run:

```sh
make
```

Here are certain commands that you might find useful:

- Make a virtual environment

```sh
make v
```

- Install all dependencies including optional dependencies

```sh
make i
```

> **Note**: This project uses optional dependency groups such as `types`,
> `code_quality`, `docs`, `vulnerability`, `test`, and `misc`. To install stubs
> or types for the dependencies, you **must** use the following command:
>
> ```sh
> uv add types-foo --group types
> ```
>
> Replace `types-foo` with the name of the package for the types. All runtime
> dependencies should be added to the `default` group. For example, to install
> `requests` and its type stubs, run:
>
> ```sh
> uv add requests
> uv add types-requests --group types
> ```
>
> This ensures that the type checker functions correctly.
>
> **Note**: Since the dependencies are segregated into groups, if you add a new
> group make sure to add it in `make install` command in [Makefile](Makefile).

- Run tests

```sh
make t
```

- Run linter, formatter and spell checker

```sh
make fl
```

- Build the documentation

```sh
make d
```

> **Note**: If you make changes to the code, make sure to generate and push the
> documentation using above command, else the documentation check CI will fail.
> Do NOT edit auto-generated documentation manually.

- Run type checker

```sh
make tc
```

- Run all pre-commit checks

```sh
make pc
```

> **Note**: This is not the complete list of commands, run `make` to find out if
> more have been added.

### Environment reproducibility

#### Editor Config

To ensure a consistent code style across the project, we include an
`.editorconfig` file that defines the coding styles for different editors and
IDEs. Most modern editors support this file format out of the box, but you might
need to install a plugin for some editors. Please refer to the
[EditorConfig website][editor-config].

#### Setting environment variables (direnv)

Our project uses [.envrc files][direnv] to manage environment variables.
Wherever such a file is required across the project tree, you will find a
`.envrc.template` file that contains the necessary variables and helps you
create your own personal copy of each file. You can find the locations of all
`.envrc.template` files by executing `find . -type f -name \.envrc\.template` in
the root directory. For each, create a copy named `.envrc` in the same
directory, open it in a text editor and replace the template/example values with
your own personal and potentially confidential values.

**Warning:** Be careful not to leak sensitive information! In particular,
**never** add your secrets to the `.envrc.template` files directly, as these are
committed to version control and will be visible to anyone with access to the
repository. Always create an `.envrc` copy first (capitalization and punctuation
matter!), as these (along with `.env` files) are ignored from version control.

Once you have filled in all of your personal information, you can have the
`direnv` tool manage setting your environment variables automatically (depending
on the directory you are currently in and the particular `.envrc` file defined
for that directory) by executing the following command:

```sh
direnv allow
```

## Versioning

The project adopts the [semantic versioning][semver] scheme for versioning.
Currently the software is in a pre-release stage, so changes to the API,
including breaking changes, may occur at any time without further notice.
