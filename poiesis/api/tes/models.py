            - `ubuntu`

            - `gcr.io/my-org/my-image`

            Example: "ubuntu:20.04"
        command: A sequence of program arguments to execute, where the first argument
            is the program to execute (i.e. argv). Example:

            If not defined, the system will default to the directory set by
            the container image.
            Example: "/data/"
        stdin: Path inside the container to a file which will be piped
            to the executor's stdin. This must be an absolute path. This mechanism
            could be used in conjunction with the input declaration to process
            a data file using a tool that expects STDIN.

            For example, to get the MD5 sum of a file by reading it into the STDIN:
            ```
            {"command": ["/bin/md5"], "stdin": "/data/file1"}
            ```
            Example: "/data/file1"
        stdout: Path inside the container to a file where the executor's
            stdout will be written to. Must be an absolute path. Example:
            ```
            {"stdout": "/tmp/stdout.log"}
            ```
            Example: "/tmp/stdout.log"
        stderr: Path inside the container to a file where the executor's
            stderr will be written to. Must be an absolute path. Example:
            ```
            {"stderr": "/tmp/stderr.log"}
            ```
            Example: "/tmp/stderr.log"

        ignore_error: Default behavior of running an array of executors is that
            execution stops on the first error. If `ignore_error` is `True`, then
            the runner will record error exit codes, but will continue on to the

class TesTask(BaseModel):
    """Task describes a task to be run.

    Args:
        id: Task identifier assigned by the server.
            Example: "job-0012345"
        state: Task state
        name: User-provided task name.
        description: Optional user-provided description of task for documentation
            purposes.
        inputs: Input files that will be used by the task. Inputs will be downloaded
            and mounted into the executor container as defined by the task request
            document.
            Example: [{"url": "s3://my-object-store/file1", "path": "/data/file1"}]
        outputs: Output files.
            Outputs will be uploaded from the executor container to long-term storage.
            Example: [
                {
                    "path": "/data/outfile",
                    "url": "s3://my-object-store/outfile-1",
                    "type": "FILE",
                }
            ]
        resources: Resources requested by the task
        executors: An array of executors to be run. Each of the executors will run one
            at a time sequentially. Each executor is a different command that
            will be run, and each can utilize a different docker image. But each of
            the executors will see the same mapped inputs and volumes that are declared
            in the parent CreateTask message.

            Execution stops on the first error.
        volumes: Volumes are directories which may be used to share data between
            Executors. Volumes are initialized as empty directories by the
            system when the task starts and are mounted at the same path
            in each Executor.

            For example, given a volume defined at `/vol/A`,
            executor 1 may write a file to `/vol/A/exec1.out.txt`, then
            executor 2 may read from that file.

            (Essentially,this translates to a `docker run -v` flag where
            the container path is the same for each executor).
            Example: ["/vol/A/"]
        tags: A key-value map of arbitrary tags. These can be used to store
            meta-data and annotations about a task. Example:
            ```
            {"tags": {"WORKFLOW_ID": "cwl-01234", "PROJECT_GROUP": "alice-lab"}}
            ```
            Example: {"WORKFLOW_ID": "cwl-01234", "PROJECT_GROUP": "alice-lab"}
        logs: Task logging information.
            Normally, this will contain only one entry, but in the case where
            a task fails and is retried, an entry will be appended to this list.
        creation_time: Date + time the task was created, in RFC 3339 format.
            This is set by the system, not the client.
            Example: "2020-10-02T10:00:00-05:00"
